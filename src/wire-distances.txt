adjacent combinators are 1 block apart
combinators with one space in between are 2 block apart

for combinators of size 2, distance is measured from closest port,
not necessarily the port you're connecting to!

combinator -> combinator = 10 blocks apart
combinator -> steel pole = 10 blocks apart
steel pole -> steel pole =  9 blocks apart
